## Basic Overview
Every experiment implies acquiring some measurement data, saving  and analyzing it. While workinng at P.L. Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences I was asked to wrtite a software to perform afore mentioned tasks for several instruments:
 
* 6221 Keithley Precision DC and AC+DC Low Noise Current Source
* 2000 Keithley Precision Multimeter
* 5110 EG&G Princeton Applied Research Lock-In Amplifier
* KUSB-3116 Keithley 16-Bit USB DAQ Module

As a result I have written 9 Pre-Alpha versions, 6 Alpha versions and 3 Beta versions.

The current version is [Beta Ver 1.2.vi](https://github.com/lordonium/Labview-Acquisition-Software/blob/master/Beta/Beta%20Ver%201.2.vi). 

## Details 

###### Instruments

Most of the instruments did not give any trouble while indtalling all the necessary libraries. Practically all of them had a support from National Instruments. However, Lock-In's libs were a little bit outdated, so I had to fix it by replacing the 'Visa open' function with the new one.

To our greatest fears the DAQ was ~~a pain in the ass~~. Not only did it have faulty drivers, it also got possesed by a demon. Actually, Keithley company was purchased by Tektronix and consequently they canceled the support for this product. As a result, the libs could only be installed only on the *LabVIEW 7.1*. After some magic was applied I found the original company who producers the original DAQ boards and got from their official website all the needed drivers and libs.

###### Software

Here I will explain the main parts in order for the users to speed up the compilation process.

1. **[Beta Ver 1.2.vi](https://github.com/lordonium/Labview-Acquisition-Software/blob/master/Beta/Beta%20Ver%201.2.vi)**

To be written

If by any chance you know Russian, you can read a very detailed explanation of the project in this report: [Report](https://github.com/lordonium/Labview-Acquisition-Software/blob/master/media/report.pdf)
